Linux  Commands

Click on the Terminal at button[ it will be a square balck button].
Terminal application will open. It will be black screen

Linux commands are case sensitive.




Check Version of OS installed

$ lsb_release -a
   LSB here is Linux standard Base

Clear the terminal Screen
$ clear

Present working directory or the current directory you are working on
$ pwd

List the contents of a particular directory
$ ls

List of contents of a particular directory
$ ls Desktop/
            $ ls /tmp

Show contents of a directory in a list format
$ ls -l

Show all the files as well as hidden files and directories
            $ ls -al

Manual page for linux commands 
 You will give : man linux command
It will display all details of the command and its options.

Example : man pwd

Come out of the page - press q
  
Create a new Directory 
$ mkdir testdir
Creates a new directory in the current directory
Verify if the directory is created or not
$ ls

 Go to a directory
             $ cd testdir
         You will be inside the testdir directory
               Now give ls or ls -al

                 There are no files or directories in it.
                 You will see something as . and ..
                 Here . represents its current working directory
                 Here .. represents previous or parent working directory

 Create a file inside the directory
> create an empty file in the directory

$ touch file1
$ ls ⇒ you will see the file in the directory
$ cat file1 ⇒This command prints the contents of the file,  no contents in the file

Add lines inside the file => file1

$ echo “Hello All” > file1

Create a file with name file2 and add contents into the file
$ echo “ hello everyone!” > file2

In the above command echo will create a file with name file2 and will also add content “hello everyone!” into it.

$ cat file2

Now overwrite the contents of the file2

$ echo “Hello DevOps” > file2

Now append more lines to file2

$ echo “Learning Linux commands” >> file2

Now append lines in the same line not a new line to file 2

$ echo -n “append in same line” >> file2
$ echo -n “foo” >> file2
$ echo -n “bar” >> file2
$ cat file2

Use up arrow  or down arrow to get previous commands


 
using Vim editor

vim file1

press i

enter data

press esc --> :wq!
give ls

file will be in directory

Create one more file

Creta file using nano editor

nano file1

just enter data ==> new file

ctl x ==> exit at bottom

presss y to give yes

press enter

out of file
Ls
15.
          Make a copy of an exisitng file

          cp sourcefile newfilename

          cp file1 copiedfile

           ls

          cat copiedfile

          file content will be same

16. Rename a file

$ mv file1 newfilename

ls 
File 1 will not be there.. New file will be there with name newfilename

This command is also used to move a file from 1 directory to another

$ mv file1 /tmp/newfile

17. USER management & permissions of a File

Become a super user to provide privileged access to create, and installation

by default in root is the privileged user and you can become a root user by giving command

$ sudo su -

superuser do superuser -

18. 

create a user in Linux

first become root user and then execute these commands.

$ useradd alice
$ useradd bob

cat /etc/passwd ==> users in this system that have been created, at end you will see alice and bob also

19. 

Delete a User
********

userdel bob

to check the output

give cat /etc/passwd

or 

tail /etc/passwd ==> will return last lines

you will see bob is deleted

20.
Create a user group

what is a group ==> set of users form a group

commad to create a group

# groupadd caltech ==> creates a new group

see the group created

# cat /etc/group  ==> shows information about all the groups, at end see you group name
right now there is no user in it

scroll up and see other groups like wheel which has user ec2-user
wheel:x:10:ec2-user

adm group which has user ec2-user


adm:x:4:ec2-user

extreme right is user and left is group name

Also note that, when we just create a user, it also creates a group with same name as user
hence you see alice and bob at the end


21.
****************

Now add users to the created group== command ==> usermod


# usermod -G caltech alice

modify user and add alice user to group purdue

-g ==> group 

# cat /etc/group

caltech:x:1003:alice

***********************************

22. Change Permissions of a file



File Permissions
$ ls -l

You will see we have 2 files file1 file2

You will see

-rw-rw-r-r

Here

: in beginning means file(-) or directory(d) or symlink(l)
                  rw- : shows what current user can do in this file
                  rw- : 2nd set herr show what users in the group can do on this file
                  R-r : 3rd set of permission is for other users that are not part of the group




Change permission of file file1

current permissions : -rw-rw-r-- 1 ec2-user ec2-user  177 Feb  6 02:20 file1


change permissions for all users of the file: add executable permissions to the all users, owner + group + all users other than the group

# chmod a+x file1

here 

a+x ==> a = all users(user, group , all users) , + add permission, x : executable permission

new permission:

-rwxrwxr-x 1 ec2-user ec2-user  177 Feb  6 02:20 file1  : executable added for all users

Example 2:

Now chnage permssion for group.. remove excutable permission for group on the file

ls -al

-rwxrwxr-x 1 ec2-user ec2-user  177 Feb  6 02:20 file1

chmod g-x file1

-rwxrw-r-x 1 ec2-user ec2-user  177 Feb  6 02:20 file1

Example 3:

remove executable for only main user of file

chmod u-x file1

-rw-rw-r-x 1 ec2-user ec2-user  177 Feb  6 02:20 file1


Example 4:

add executable permission to main user

chmod u+x file1

-rwxrw-r-- 1 ec2-user ec2-user  177 Feb  6 02:20 file

Example 5:

remove executable permission for others only

chmod o-x file1

-rwxrw-r-- 1 ec2-user ec2-user  177 Feb  6 02:20 file1
